Consider a scenario in which both secure boot and measured boot are in place, surprisingly a potential vulnerability can still arise if the Nix Store remains unencrypted. Ordinarily, the Nix store is left unencrypted as it is not perceived to contain sensitive information. Yet, there exists a potential threat if an item within the Nix store is tampered with, such as modifying the bash or gcc components. Presently, there is no optimal solution to address this issue aside from advising users to encrypt their Nix store, ensuring authentication through the encryption mechanism.

Alternatively, a more sophisticated approach involves integrated checking for the store. During the initrd phase, the Nix store is verified, and its signature is authenticated against predefined criteria, such as signatures from the cache at nixos.org, a public key, or a designated public key. This proactive measure prevents the injection of a manipulated Nix store path by unauthorised individuals. Implementing integrated checks for the store establishes a comprehensive verification trust chain for all elements in the NixOS boot process.

Deploying a system with robust security measures, including TPM2, secure boot, and integrated checks, significantly raises the complexity of compromising the system, although complete immunity remains a challenging goal.
