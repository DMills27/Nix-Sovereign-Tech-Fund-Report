In the ongoing efforts to ensure the security of NixOS systems configured with secure boot, the primary objective is to extend the verification process to include the system closure on the Nix-store partition or filesystem. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the entire system, considering that existing tools like Lanzaboote, systemd, and UEFI handle various stages of verification but lack a comprehensive check on the system closure of stage 2.

The proposed solution involves leveraging the nix-store verify command within the standalone Nix command. By doing so, it establishes an efficient and reliable method to verify all software components within the system closure without resorting to duplicating disk images. Notably, this approach distinguishes itself from alternatives like dm-verity, which poses limitations on highly immutable filesystems like NixOS.

However, it's essential to acknowledge a significant drawback associated with this approachâ€”the introduction of a noticeable boot delay. On systems with higher processing capabilities, this delay might range between 5-10 seconds, whereas lower-end devices, such as a Raspberry Pi on an SD card, might experience a delay of up to 2 minutes. This trade-off between verification thoroughness and boot time necessitates careful consideration and testing.

To address potential issues that may arise, such as alterations to the Nix database, comprehensive testing is imperative. The effectiveness of the verification process under various scenarios needs validation to ensure the system's robustness against potential threats.

Looking ahead, there's a strategic exploration of alternative solutions to mitigate the boot delay while maintaining the high standards of verification. One such avenue involves examining the feasibility of implementing a feature analogous to Apple's signed system volume within bcachefs. This entails placing a signature on the root node of the filesystem, offering a simplified verification process for stage 1. The discussion also extends to the possibility of leveraging dm-verify or creating a dm-verify image for each Nix store path in the verified system closure. While these alternatives introduce added complexity, they offer potential pathways for future enhancements.

As the current phase of work nears completion, the focus shifts to necessary cleanup, extensive testing to uncover any potential pitfalls, and strategic planning for the subsequent stages of development. This multifaceted approach seeks to strike a balance between heightened system security and maintaining a reasonable boot time for an optimal user experience.
