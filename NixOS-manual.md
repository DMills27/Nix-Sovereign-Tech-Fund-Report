# Understanding Enhanced Security Features in NixOS

-- Write a better intro that details the various security features being discussed and how they interrelate to one another.

Increasing security within NixOS and Nixpkgs is vital for wider adoption. The Nix ecosystem faces unique challenges due its declarative nature which sets it apart from other Linux distributions, and requires more nuanced and novel approaches to deal with issues related to security, in particular. Perhaps, the most visible of these differences is the inclusion of NixOS generations in the bootloader upon starting one's machine, which allows one to choose from various (older) stages of the operating system every time the configuration file is changed and the system is rebuilt. This might lead one to ask questions such as:
- Does the inclusion of generations increase the number of potential vulnerabilties that a potential attacker can exploit? 
- What mechanisms are in place to ensure potential vulnerabilties from an existing generation don't propagate to newer ones as they are generated? 

However, even before getting to this point one might inquire:
how secure is the process leading up to the bootloader becoming active and thereafter? Moreover, what processes are in place to ensure the accuracy, consistency and reliabilty of data being sent between Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the boot process, that is, what are the so-called Integrity Checks in place? Here Stage 1 and Stage 2 refer to the processes for booting the Linux kernel, which comprise of details such as the kernel image, initrd (initial ramdisk), and kernel parameters for initiating the operating system (Stage 1), as well as, booting other bootloaders or operating systems, by pointing to a specific Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) binary or bootloader, and are not necessarily limited to booting Linux operating systems (Stage 2). Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the interpreted languages that NixOS sometimes uses (Python, Perl and Bash) in the background allows for runtime flexibility but also introduces potential security risks, as the interpreter must handle and execute code in real-time.  We detail the mechanisms in place to deal with issues in the forthcoming sub-sections.  


## Secure boot

By default, NixOS, like other Linux distributions, requires a security feature called Secure Boot to be disabled, upon initial installation, which leaves it susceptible to attacks such as bootkits, that can gain unauthorised access to a system during the boot process. The Secure Boot process ensures that only signed and trusted code is executed during the system startup, guarding against unauthorized or malicious software.

Initally, the Lanzaboote project was developed to ameliorate this issue by providing a tool that facilitates the signing of custom Secure Boot components with user-defined keys, such as Microsoft keys. However, its implementation was unsatisfactory in the sense it required one to first install NixOS via an insecure boot then install Lanzaboote to have secure boot in effect when NixOS is subsequently booted. This was undesirable as ideally we should have boot security by default when installing NixOS for the first time.

This led to the development of a feature that would enable UEFI secure boot by default for NixOS installer images. This consists of two aspects:
 1. Constructing a shim for NixOS, which is a first-stage boot loader, which, in turn, is a program that is executed by a computer's hardware during the initial boot process such as the UEFI, that embeds a self-signed certificate from a trusted entity known as the Certificate Authority (CA). Microsoft signs shim binaries, which ensures that they can be booted on all machines with a pre-loaded Microsoft certificate.
2. Then creating an ISO from the NixOS-shim that is then submitted for review by the shim-review committee which is a community-driven solution endorsed by Microsoft, allowing open-source contributors to request signature validation. 

## Measured Boot
While secure boot provides a greater degree of security, it is still susceptible to attacks such as rootkits, which can conceal their presence or the presence of other undesirable software on a computer, or Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks, which can inject code into memory during the boot process. We can gain a greater level of security through an extra layer of security called Measured Boot. 

Measured Boot records a hash of each system component onto the Trusted Platform Module 2.0 (TPM2) as the system boots. This entails measuring each component, using memory locations called Platform Configuration Registers, from the firmware to the boot start drivers, which are then hashed. These measurements are then securely stored in the TPM2, and a log is produced, facilitating remote verification of the client's boot state.

Unlike Secure Boot, Measured Boot has a hardware dependency â€“ Trusted Platform Module 2.0 (TPM2). The TPM is typically a dedicated microcontroller integrated into a computer's motherboard or as a separate hardware component that provides a secure means for storing sensitive information, performing cryptographic operations, and enhancing overall system security.

## Bootspec V2

Bootspec refers to a JSON document that contains metadata related to the boot process of a NixOS generation, which functions as an intermediate bridge (IR) between the NixOS system definition and the tools tasked with managing the bootloader.
Some of these tools include:

* Multiple Profiles: which allows users to maintain different configurations or sets of packages. Each profile represents a distinct environment with its own package set, dependencies, and configurations. This enables users to switch between different system states or use cases easily.

* Generation Limits: In the context of NixOS, a generation limit refers to the maximum number of past generations (system configurations) that are retained.

* Initrd Secrets: Initrd (initial ramdisk) secrets are cryptographic keys required during the initial stages of the system boot process. These secrets are used to unlock encrypted partitions or perform other security-related tasks before the main operating system is fully loaded.

* Specialisation: Specialisation in NixOS involves tailoring the system configuration to specific use cases or requirements, such as development, server hosting, or desktop usage.

* Custom Labels: Custom labels refer to user-defined labels or tags associated with NixOS configurations. These labels can be used to identify and organize different system states, profiles, or generations.


The main motivation behind Bootspec, in general, is to support a uniform collection of features and design decisions, such as those previously listed, which aren't often supported partially due to the complexity of implementing such features in a particular bootloader, such as those on lower end devices, such as a RaspberryPI or Extlinux. When supported, it is often through globbing directories, that is, by specifying sets of filenames with wildcard characters then utilizing these wildcards to match and locate files according to a predefined pattern. This approach poses several challenges; the main of which is the inherent complexity and significant effort when  introducing new bootloader features or enhancing older ones. Bootspec, thus, addresses the challenges of feature extension in bootloaders, reducing the fragility and maintenance issues associated with disparate public APIs in nixpkgs. 

Bootspec V1, the first iteration of Bootspec, dealt with a number of issues but exhibited gaps, such as the lack of information about device trees, which are data structures used to describe the hardware configuration of a system, particularly in embedded systems and open architecture platforms. Bootspec V2 addresses this by reevaluating the initrd secret feature, which has proven insecure and problematic since it starts to omit a cryptographic key file when upgrading the version of NixOS. In Bootspec V2, the goal is to replace initrd secrets with systemd-creds, which securely stores and retrieves credentials used by systemd units, to significantly enhance security in the NixOS boot process. Users can encrypt these credentials to TPM2, store them in /boot (even on the boot partition), and then have TPM2 unlock them before booting. This approach ensures compatibility with a broader range of systems (such as remote desktops, server farms, etc).

## Portable executable binaries

Portable Executable (PE) binaries refer to executable files that adhere to the PE file format. The PE format is a file structure used for executables, object code, DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries), and other types of files used in Windows operating systems. PE files have a structured layout that includes different sections, each serving a specific purpose. The two primary types of sections are the "code section" and the "data section":

- **Code Section**: The code section contains the actual executable instructions or machine code that the computer's processor executes. The code section is marked as executable and read-only to ensure that the program's instructions are not modified during runtime.

- **Data Section**: The data section, on the other hand, stores various types of data that the program uses during its execution. This data can include global variables, constants, static data structures, and other information that needs to be stored in the executable file. Unlike the code section, the data section may have read and write permissions, allowing the program to modify its own data during runtime.

Of particular interest is the data section which includes critical information such as digital signatures, checksums, configuration settings, or other data necessary for the proper functioning and security of the executable. Read and write support for the data section is crucial for verifying and updating this information as needed. By having separate sections for code and data, PE files follow a modular structure that allows for efficient organization and management of the program's components. This separation also aligns with security principles, enabling control over the permissions associated with code and data to prevent unintended modifications and maintain the integrity of the executable.

However, making changes to the internal structure of a Portable Executable (PE) file, can be quite challenging. As it often involves rewriting entire structures, such as headers or data sections, within the file. Additionally, adjusting these structures may require recalculating the positions of various components, such as section headers, due to space constraints. To tackle this complexity rather than directly modifying the PE structures, we propose the strategy of introducing a "meta-writer structure". This meta-writer structure doesn't belong to the original PE file but serves as a higher-level guide. It keeps track of essential information needed to recreate the existing PE file while also incorporating details about any new sections being introduced. Essentially, it acts as a helpful tool for managing the intricacies of modifying the PE file without the need for a complete overhaul of its internal structures. Moreover, the dynamic nature of this process necessitates reading and rewriting PE binaries, requiring a library designed for this purpose. Currently, the only available library is written in Go, while Lanzaboote is implemented in Rust. One of our objectives is to develop a secure, memory-efficient PE library to address this limitation.

Our goals are to replace the existing complex library, Objcopy, and providing Rust-based functionality. Goblin, a Rust-based PE library, now supports PE write support. The subsequent challenge involves signing, which involves storing certificates and private keys, within the data section, securely. To achieve this, the industry-standard Public-Key Cryptography Standard #11 (PKCS#11) protocol is employed, allowing secure token storage (e.g., TPM2, YubiKey) and defining an API for signing operations.

The PKCS#11 standard, though effective, is known for its complexity. To simplify the signing process, the Goblin Signing subcrate for Rust has been introduced. It not only streamlines the signing procedure but also adheres to Microsoft's signing scheme, a hierarchical code signing structure based on multiple certificates and certificate authorities. This intricate signing scheme requires careful handling, especially regarding file hashing to prevent vulnerabilities. Goblin Signing, as part of the upstream features, addresses these complexities, ensuring a robust and secure signing process in the UEFI and PE context.

## A/B Schema in NixOS
The A/B schema in this context refers to general methodologies facilitating primary and secondary booting, involving the existence of two distinct boot partitions. During an upgrade, the updated content is written to the primary partition. In the event of a boot failure, the system automatically switches to the secondary partition, executing a rollback of the unsuccessful update. This conventional approach safeguards embedded systems from disruptions during upgrades by maintaining two separate boot partitions that are not simultaneously upgraded. Within NixOS and, more specifically, systemd-boot, a mechanism has been implemented that leverages the NixOS generation system to monitor boot occurrences and initiate automatic fallbacks. While not directly related to boot security, this feature is integral to the autonomy of systems on NixOS, impacting both boot functionality and overall security. Its presence is crucial, as it significantly influences users' willingness to engage in boot processes and system upgrades.
